                Unamused is a custom unset made by me, Evella. I've been a fan of magic for years and the thing that truly drew me into the game was silver bordered cards. Itâ€™s the endless possibilities and fun of MTG, now with 1,000% more squirrels. What's not to love?
So, like any rational person would, I began making custom cards. What started as a few stray designs, began forming into a full-fledged set. After feverish design and testing the set was almost complete. That was 2 years ago. It turns out you can tinker with something forever if you let yourself. Eventually, enough was enough and it was time to release a final version.

                Once that I finally committed myself to actually finishing this damn thing, I begun the Journey of daily posts, website making, proofreading, and testing.
I know that I'll be making last minute changes all the way up to the final hour; but even with all the little pieces of regretful mistakes and perfection just out of reach, it will always be worth more to share my passion with others. I hope my projects can bring someone as much joy as it brings me, and I truly hope you're that someone.
